## v0.3.0

  This Release focuses on the API and making it more accessible for developers to access functions without the UI.

  **New Features**:
  - You can now long-live api tokens to interact with API from the user settings page.
    - These tokens have the same permissions as your user.
  - Helpful swagger page for API usage.
  - Some API's were refactored for friendlier API usage, moving some attributes to parameters and first looking for a api token, then using the stored cookie if none is found. This allows for all api requests from swagger page to work without a token.
  - Add file size to search preview! Should have been in last release... sorry!

  **Notes**:
  - Replaced backend http framework with go standard library.
  - Right-click Context menu can target the item that was right-clicked. To fully address https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/214

  **Notes**:
