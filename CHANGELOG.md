# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. For commit guidelines, please refer to [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).

## v0.3.0

  This Release focuses on the API and making it more accessible for developers to access functions without the UI.

  **New Features**:
  - You can now long-live api tokens to interact with API from the user settings page.
    - These tokens have the same permissions as your user.
  - Helpful swagger page for API usage.
  - Some API's were refactored for friendlier API usage, moving some attributes to parameters and first looking for a api token, then using the stored cookie if none is found. This allows for all api requests from swagger page to work without a token.
  - Add file size to search preview! Should have been in last release... sorry!

  **Notes**:
  - Replaced backend http framework with go standard library.
  - Right-click Context menu can target the item that was right-clicked. To fully address https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/214
  - adjusted settings menu for mobile, always shows all available cards rather than grayed out cards that need to be clicked.
  - longer and more cryptographically secure share links based on UUID rather than base64.

  - Fixed ui bug with shares with password.
