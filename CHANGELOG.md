# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. For commit guidelines, please refer to [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).

## v0.7.6-beta

NOTE: if using docker arm32 image, you will need to switch to the slim images. The regular docker images are much larger now and support generating office previews out of the box without any only office running. However, they don't support arm32. Also, be aware the docker images are much larger now (600MB I believe) because of the office document preview support -- if thats not something you care about you can switch to the slim images.

 **New Features**:
 - native document preview generation enabled for certain document types on the regular docker image (no office integration needed)
   - supported native document preview types:
     - ".pdf",  // PDF
     - ".xps",  // XPS
     - ".epub", // EPUB
     - ".mobi", // MOBI
     - ".fb2",  // FB2
     - ".cbz",  // CBZ
     - ".svg",  // SVG
     - ".txt",  // TXT
     - ".doc",  // DOC
     - ".docx", // DOCX
     - ".ppt",  // PPT
     - ".pptx", // PPTX
     - ".xls",  // excel xls
     - ".xlsx", // exel XLSX
     - ".hwp",  // HWP
     - ".hwp",  // HWPX
 - proxy logout redirectUrl support via `auth.methods.proxy.logoutRedirectUrl` https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/684

 **Notes**:
 - image loading placeholders added and remain if image can't be loaded.

## v0.6.0-beta

> [!WARNING]
> This release includes several config changes that could cause issues. Please backup your database file before upgrading.

This release has several changes that should work without issues... however, still backup your database file first and proceed with caution. User permissions and source config changes have been updated -- and the `server.root` paramter is no longer used.

This is a significant step towards a stable release. There shouldn't be any major breaking config changes after this.

 **New Features**:
  - multiple sources support https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/360
    - listing view keeps them independant, you switch between the two and the url address will have a prefix `/files/<sourcename>/path/to/file` when there is more than 1 source.
    - search also happens independantly, with a selection toggle per source. searching current source searches the current scope in the listing view, if you toggle to an alternative source it will search from the source root.
    - copy/moving is currently only supported within the same source -- that will come in a future release.
  - `FILEBROWSER_CONFIG` environment variable is respected if no CLI config parameter is provided. https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/413

 **Notes**:
  - downloads no longer open new window.
  - swagger updated with auth api help for things like api token.
    - GET api keys now uses `name` query instead of `key`. eg `GET /api/auth/tokens?name=apikeyname`
  - user permissions simplified to four permission groups (no config change required):
    - **removed**  : create, rename, delete, download
    - **remaining**: admin, modify, share, api
    - `scope` is deprecated, but still supported, applies to default source. if using multiple sources, set `defaultUserScope` at the [source config](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/wiki/Configuration#default-source-configuration) instead.
  - **removed** user rules and commands.
    - commands feature has never been enabled so just removing the references.
    - rules will come back in a different form (not applied to the user).
  - `server.root` is completely removed in favor of `server.sources`

 **BugFixes**:
  - fix conflict resolution issue https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/384
  - many user creation page bugfixes.
  - fix share delete issue https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/408
