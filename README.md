## About

Filebrowser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory
and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit your files.
It allows the creation of multiple users and each user can have its own
directory. It can be used as a standalone app.

This repository is a fork, a collection of changes that make this program
work better in terms of asthetics and performance. Improved search,
 simplified ui (without removing features) and more secure and up-to-date
 build are just a few examples.

## Install

Using docker:

1. docker run (no persistent db):

```
docker run -it -v /path/to/folder:/srv -p 80:80 gtstef/filebrowser
```

1. docker-compose:

  - with local storage

```
version: '3.7'
services:
  filebrowser:
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/folder:/srv' # required (for now not configurable)
      - './database:/database'  # optional if you want db to persist - configure a path under "database" dir in config file.
      - './filebrowser.yaml:/filebrowser.yaml' # required
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    image: gtstef/filebrowser
    restart: always
```

  - with network share

```
version: '3.7'
services:
  filebrowser:
    volumes:
      - 'storage:/srv' # required (for now not configurable)
      - './database:/database'  # optional if you want db to persist - configure a path under "database" dir in config file.
      - './filebrowser.yaml:/filebrowser.yaml' # required
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    image: gtstef/filebrowser
    restart: always
volumes:
  storage:
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: "username=admin,password=password,rw" # enter valid info here
      device: "//192.168.1.100/share/"         # enter valid hinfo here

```

Not using docker (not recommended)

```
./filebrowser -f <filebrowser.yml or other /path/to/config.yaml>
```

## Configuration

All configuration is now done via a single configuration file: `filebrowser.yaml`, here is an example minimal [configuration file](./backend/filebrowser.yaml).

View the [Configuration Help Page](./configuration.md) for available configuration options and other help.


## Migration from filebrowser/filebrowser

If you are currently using filebrowser from the filebrowser/filebrowser repo, but want to try using this. I recommend you start fresh without reusing the database, but there are a few things you'll need to do if you must migrate:

1. Create a configuration file as mentioned above.
2. Copy your database file from the original filebrowser to the path of the new one.
3. Update the configuration file to use the database (under server in filebrowser.yml)
4. If you are using docker, update the docker-compose file or docker run command to use the config file as described in the install section above.
5. If you are not using docker, just make sure you run filebrowser -f filebrowser.yml and have valid filebrowser config.


The filebrowser application should run with the same user and rules that you have from the original. But keep in mind the differences that are mentioned at the top of this readme.

### background & help

The original project filebrowser/filebrowser used multiple different ways to configure the server.
This was confusing and difficult to work with from a user and from a developer's perspective.
So I completely redesigned the program to use one single human-readable config file.

I understand many coming from the original fork may notice differences which make using this improved version more difficult. If you notice issues that you believe should be fixed, please open an issue here and it will very likely be addressed with a PR within a few weeks.

This version of filebrowser is going through a configuration overhaul as mentioned above. Certain features related to rules and commands may not work as they do on the original filebrowser. The purpose of this is to create a more consistent experience where configuration is done via files rather than running commands, so that it's very clear what the current state of the configuration is. When running commands its not clear what the configuration is.
