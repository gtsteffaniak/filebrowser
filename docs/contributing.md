# Contributing Guide

If you would like to contribute, please open a pull request against main or the latest `dev_` branch thats currently in progress.

A PR is required to have:

1. A clear description about why it was opened
2. A short title that best describes the issue.
3. Test evidence for anything that is not self evident or covered by unit tests.

Unit tests should be updated to pass before merging. So, the best way to handle this is to create a fork and test your changes there, then merge to this repo. You can also create a draft pull request if it is not fully ready.

Please don't hesitate to open an issue for any ideas you have, but cannot contribute directly for whatever reason.
